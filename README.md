# Holiday-Hiway

## Description

This is an MVC application/dashboard where users can add their Christmas-decorated home to a database to be offered for others to include in a mapped out route for a festive evening outing. A user can login to navigate between:

- listing their home to showcase,
- planning a route to view decorated homes by zip code,
- view existing posted homes by zip code,
- comment on homes

There are options to create, read, update, comment on, and delete submissions depending on authorization level. The app also utilizes the bcrypt package to protect against unauthorized use. In addition, the app utilizes the MySQL2, Sequalize, express-handlebars, dotenv, express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages and the Mapbox API to carry out functionality. mockplus.com was also employed for UI quality enhancements.

### Future expansion thoughts:

**1) User personalization**

Have user be able to select specific houses to go see and then create a map with only those self selected homes

**2) Other Holidays**

App could be upgraded to include more holiday options (eg. Fireworks displays, Easter Egg hunts, Halloween decorations, Trick or Treating allergy guide)
